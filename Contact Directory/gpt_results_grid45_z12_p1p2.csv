Quite honestly, I change my demeanor if people are gruff with me so they get it back in their face somewhat. I would imagine it's a lot of work setting up all the foods he sells. I take that into account. I like the specialty foods he has. I was looking for some asparagus but didn't see it. What I did see was brussel sprouts! I love those. I also saw lots of other unusual things which I love to try and they were very good. What I like most of all was he had avocados for about a dollar and I found one that was already ripe and one that was ripe the next day. I will definitely be going back for more avocados. There were also other unusual foods which I love to try. So I feel I've actually found a little gem of a place where I never expected it to be.

You can eat in the their indoor/outdoor lounge area.\n\nPlum Market wascreated in 2006 by brothers Matthew and Marc Jonna, third-generation grocers who first opened Merchant of Vino which expanded to 8 stores before being acquired by Whole Foods. The brothers went on to work in Whole Foods before leaving to open their own specialty market featuring natural, organic, and locally crafted items.  Mathew Jonna calls his store ""like Whole Foods, but better."" Based out of Detroit they now operate more than 25 locations across the US with plans to open more. My friend found out about the Aventura store from Instagram and after her endorsement  I stopped by to check them out after lunch in the area.\n\nThe market is set up with sections of produce, groceries, apothecary, all natural and sustainably sourced meats and seafood, sushi, wine which can shipped through their service along with caviar, locally sourced baked goods and chocolates, and prepared foods. The store features more than 100 local brands including McGregor\'s Greens, Barbacuban, The Empanada Girl, Sullivan Street Bakery, Mother Kombucha, Ella\'s Flats, Laura\'s Gourmet Granola, Cigar City, Fullei Fresh, Wish Farms, Funky Buddha Brewery, and Florida based chocolatier, Norman Love Confections & Baked Goods.  Plum Market offers a catering service that can make  hot meals, hors d\'oeuvres, sandwiches, charcuterie boards, artisanal cakes. The store has an international section and they are kosher and diet friendly.\n\nI was impressed with how the store is set up and and how clean and well presented everything was. Not so impressive are the prices. This store is aiming for the market of the well to do in Aventura although what they were charging wasn\'t keeping anyone out and store was very busy on the day after Christmas. Their prices are even higher than Whole Foods. What you get is a farmer\'s market experience but inside a grocery store. Unfortunately another factor aside from high prices that kept my visit brief was the temperature inside the store. It was 50 degrees outside and even colder in the store. I had a sweater on and I soon started shivering. When I stepped outside the store I actually warmed up. It was way too cold for me. if cost is not an issue this is a great store to find one of a kind items that can jazz up your meal time routine.

I was not offered any samples, I walked in and felt like they expected me to just tell them what I wanted exactly and leave. I was hoping I would walk in and they would explain the process, maybe offer some samples, and ask my taste preferences then recommend something. Instead they asked if I was looking for something in particular, I responded just a cool interesting bottle and the woman told me they didn’t sell individual bottles? I’m not sure what she meant. I think she thought I meant visually cool bottle but with no olive oil inside? Very strange to think that I was dumb enough to walk into an olive oil store and not want to buy olive oil. I had to just ask the man there for recommendations, bought the ones he said and left because I felt so uncomfortable because of the woman’s response to me and the lack of guidance.

After checking out, with maybe 10 items and spending more then $200 + I simply asked the cashier “if they had a loaf of Italian bread where would it be? because I didn’t see any”.. the cashier calls DJ over to see if they have bread.\n\nBefore DJ even checks, he says with an attitude  “WELL if you don’t SEE ANY THEN WE DONT HAVE IT. BUT YOU CAN BUY ONE AND PUT IT IN THE OVEN AND MAKE IT YOURSELF IT only takes 10 MINUTES” (very rude and sassy with an attitude, moving his head all kinds of ways as he walks away to go check)\n\nKeep in mind, I had one simple question, “if you have any loafs of Italian bread where would they be” I didn’t ask if someone can grab it for me, I didn’t ask how long it would take for me to make it. I just asked where would it be. I manage a store myself so I know how difficult it can be to work in retail, so I make sure I treat everyone extremely nice, as if it were my own store.\n\nAt this point I tell the cashier “wow he’s really rude. We can cash out, I don’t even want the bread anymore” as I’m saying this to the cashier DJ is about 100 feet away saying “YOU WANT SEEDS OR NO SEEDS?” I tell DJ  “I’m okay I don’t want it”, he keeps yelling “you want seeds or no seeds” over and over. At this point I’m signing my name, he sees I’m not getting the bread from him, he’s well aware his behavior was rude, the cashier looks uncomfortable how DJ is responding. DJ walks up with the bread and then walks back away with the bread with an attitude.\n\nAs I’m going to leave I speak with a manager named J, I explain the situation, she apologies. Simple. (DJ is about 50 feet away listening. He knows I’m unhappy with the way he spoke to us) Now as I walk out, DJ goes HAVE A GOOD DAY! (Again in a rude, nasty, condescending way) This guy doesn’t know how to speak to customers.. I wasn’t even a difficult customer, I’m very easy going. I was in absolute shock as I’m leaving, after talking to his manager he still wants to get the last word in and show he doesn’t care how he treated me and my mother.\n\nTo DJ if you don’t know how to speak to clients, or like your job, maybe look else where because you DO NOT belong in customer service. I will make sure I make this clear across all platforms. DJ is toxic to that store, he was HOSTILE, RUDE, CONDESCENDING, and COMPLETELY UNPLEASANT. I genuinely feel bad for anyone that has to work with such a vile human being. The level of disrespect was beyond. DJ is a liability to that store with his behavior and the way he spoke to me was almost as if we were going to fight. He had that attitude as if he was right and he didn’t care because I can’t do anything. People that act the way he does will only push away customers and even staff members. Honestly, if he spoke to someone else the way he was speaking to us, I’m sure things could have gone way worse, even physical. DJ is aggressive and antagonistic.\n\nI am frequent customer, and everyone is always VERY pleasant. I dont know if I will ever go back to this specific location but I put this here because in my 14 years of retail, and in my entire lifetime, I HAVE NEVER BEEN SPOKEN TO LIKE THIS IN ANY RETAILER.\n\nThank you to the managers  Anthony and J for hearing about my experience and apologizing on the behalf of the unethical staff member DJ.', 'date': '2 months ago'}]"

She is very professional and is interested in clients and her business.. The other owner a man, was speaking to a friend. I walked up the person behind the foot counter and requested a prosciutto and mozarrella sandwich. The lady looked at me and said, ""I do not speak english."" I said no problem and repeated my request and she seemed to understand. Then the lady turned around and kept on working on putting away store supplies and foods. I walked around and looked at the wines, and she was still working on unpacking other things for the store. She finally realized that I was waiting and watching. She then decided to focus on the sandwich order. She said ""I have to cut the meat and cheese,"" and I said yes thank you. She then got a call on her cell which was in her back pocket of her jeans. She grabbed the phone and texted out a message with her gloves which took a long time due to lack of traction on the phone. Finally she finished and then proceed to grab the prosciutto with the same gloves she was grabbing her phone and texting with. When I asked her to change the gloves before handling my food, she said ""I do not speak english."" I asked the owners to translate. They said that she had just changed the gloves. I said yes but thats before her using her phone and texting with the same gloves she was now handling food and my sandwich with. When I turned back I could see the employee was not happy or amused and I saw the faces she was making and heard her talk in Spanish about again having to change her gloves or something like that. ☠ COVID 2019 V2 is still an issue and restaurants and stores are under strict food handing guidelines. This is even a safety and cleanliness law and regulation even in normal times. Phones are dirty. Never handle raw or cooked food with dirty gloves and do not use a phone to talk and text while handling food items. I just canceled my order and walked out disappointed. Safety and cleanliness are basic requirements. Respecting clients and their health is critical. If employees cannot be bothered to make a simple sandwich and to follow health and safety guidelines, then unfortunately this is not a safe or clean store or deli that I can support, frequent or recommend.

Located on 41 near, or in, Old Naples, just be prepared for a mystery tour experience when shopping for various items.\n\nI went in looking for a bottle of white wine or champagne and was laughing to myself at the exorbitant prices on certain bottles of wine. I took a photo of pricing for Kenwood Chardonnay which is a $10 bottle of wine that was priced at $17.00.  Similarly, their selection of champagnes was disappointing and overpriced.  Just a side note - Veuve Clicquot to be a reasonable champagne at a slightly inflated price, but since they were acquired and increased production dramatically the quality is very poor, but the pricing has remained steep as they rely on their previously good reputation and recognizable label. Skip unless it's the last resort.\n\nWynn's caters to a more high-end clientele, but you can find everyday items priced reasonably here. The issue is that it's like the proverbial box of chocolates; you never know what you're going to get.  I've come in looking for deli items, or a prepared lunch or salad, and I've been very satisfied with my purchases. The store has a bakery, a meat and deli department, frozen goods, wine, beer and champagne, and again, everyday items such as canned goods, pasta and things for your pantry.  But it's not Publix and is priced according to their target audience.  You might find a can of soup that's priced just $0.50 higher than items at a chain grocery store, and you might find items that are double the price of typical items.\n\nI find the store to be a little bit dark and it can be very crowded and close quarters with even a moderate number of shoppers. As some other people have noted, the checkout experience can be cumbersome.

I placed the water bottle on the counter but it started to leak from the condensation so I placed it on the floor. Not thinking anything of it because again it was water and the presenter did see it. He made the statement that no outside beverages (alcohol) could be brought in. Never saying that I couldn’t have water. Upon checking out my purchases in which I purchased more than my entire crew. I was told after the cashier took my money. That she noticed I put my bottle on the floor when the presenter mentioned no outside alcohol. That is against their policy. I actually laughed because all I could think at that point was, Is that the reason he only gave me a sip🤔😂. I put the bottle on the counter and said ma’am this is water and I placed it on the floor because it was leaking and she was like yea with sarcasm. That is not customer service at all and if you felt that I was breaking your rules, you should have approached me about it from the start. I would never visit that place again as I did not feel any warmth or that we were even wanted there.

When I asked to try the wine he just said “no” then I chuckled thinking he was just being goofy.

Then transfer the pasta in the pan and stir it together for a couple of minutes to coat all the flavors (just make sure you remove the past a couple of minutes before it is al dente and you complete the cooking in the pan with speck and mushrooms – you might want to add a couple of tablespoons of the pasta cooking water, rich in amid, to create a little cream and get all the ingredients happy.\n\nAnyway, I am not sure how this review became a recipe, but they also have several other Italian products from biscotti to anchovies and more.

The quality, however, is not consistent with the ""image"" that Harry\'s wants to convey. Inexperienced reviewers [unsophisticated?] may go ga ga over the take away items, but any half-educated palate would not be overly impressed. Again, not bad, but not what one anticipates. I MUST say that the kitchen seems well organized, clean and they likely do all they can within whatever parameters they have to work with.\n2. Price: simply over-priced, particularly for the portion size.\n3. Value: If convenience alone is the standard, acceptable to decent value. Otherwise, Harry\'s Deli  is not a value proposition.\n\nConclusion: Liven/spice up the offerings, lower the prices by 25% [which would still be 10%+ over the prepared-food offerings at Whole Foods or Fresh Market] and Harry\'s could begin to make real sense, particularly if one is staying in the area.', 'date': '4 months ago'}, {'username': 'Ryan Parker', 'rating': 5, 'description': 'If you’re looking for a good sandwich search no further.
