Several locations, which may mean lots of procedures",ChIJmb6kSDZ_54gRowDRme47G0k,"The Fresh Market's upscale and gourmet focus, along with its offerings of local produce and organic products, suggests a strong alignment with high-quality, mono-floral honey from a small family-owned apiary. Their emphasis on quality and the old-world vibe may appeal to customers looking for unique and artisanal food items.",8,159,0.0202

Might be online only.,ChIJyZdkgPuD54gRqtF-E30N4x0,"The Ancient Olive Gourmet of Winter Garden specializes in gourmet food products, as evidenced by customer reviews highlighting their selection of olive oils, vinegars, and other gourmet items.

Seriously Great Market Solution,1.0,No reviews or website,ChIJu9MkmVF_54gRwZIoka6RoQk,"Without specific information on their focus on gourmet or local products, it's difficult to assess the compatibility. The designation as a 'Grocery store' is broad and does not inherently suggest a specialty in gourmet items. Therefore, the compatibility is moderate, assuming they may have some interest in quality products but not necessarily a gourmet focus.",4,1,0.0078
Tn Food & Grocery,4.0,No focus on gourmet,ChIJmfVTDG2D54gRFdvotMCET7U,"Tn Food & Grocery appears to be a local store with a focus on homemade food and a friendly atmosphere. However, there is no clear indication that they specialize in gourmet products or have a specific interest in curating products from small businesses. The compatibility is moderate as they may still be interested in high-quality local products, but their primary focus does not seem to align perfectly with a specialty honey producer.",4,1,0.0173
Holson's Produce,5.0,No website but maybe.,ChIJo5_x_gV554gRp3F5Ml9JGxY,"Holson's Produce appears to be a market that focuses on fresh produce and meats, with a community-oriented customer base. While they may appreciate high-quality products, their emphasis does not seem to be on gourmet or specialty items, which may limit the compatibility with a premium mono-floral honey. However, as a local business, they might still be open to stocking unique items from other small businesses.",4,1,0.0147
Suns Market,3.0,"Family owned so that's a plus, but gas station vibes. No gourmet.",ChIJwVN3bHOD54gRSlij1UhudVc,"Suns Market does not appear to specialize in gourmet food products or emphasize support for local small businesses. The reviews suggest it is a convenience store with a focus on subs and general grocery items, which does not align well with a high-quality, mono-floral honey product.",2,1,0.0165
SC Foods,4.0,I don't know what this is but there's no focus on gourmet.,ChIJ2esYs3yP54gRAarbKINxxME,"SC Foods, being a grocery store, may carry a variety of food products, but there is no specific information suggesting a focus on gourmet or locally-sourced items. This could mean a moderate level of compatibility, as they may still be interested in high-quality products, but they might not prioritize small business partnerships.",6,1,0.0077
Colonial Grocery Deli & Bodega,6.5,Ethnic market. Strong focus on local. No clear gourmet but small.,ChIJEaAcVKx554gRbVLiyDDehHI,"While Colonial Grocery Deli & Bodega has a high rating and seems to offer a variety of Latin groceries and prepared foods, there is no specific mention of a focus on gourmet or artisanal products. This suggests that the store may not be the ideal venue for a specialty item like high-quality, mono-floral honey from a small family-owned business.",3,1,0.015
Trader Joe's,4.0,Massive chain. Too much red tape.,ChIJbeFK_p5_54gRGvfzUjKvlFA,"Trader Joe's offers a variety of organic and gourmet products, which could be a good fit for high-quality, mono-floral honey. However, as a large national chain, it may not prioritize small, local producers to the extent a smaller gourmet grocer would. The emphasis on private label products could also limit opportunities for external brands.",5,530,0.0245
JNM Super Market,1.0,Gas station. ,ChIJIxxg6f9-54gRVzC_PSR-wn8,"JNM Super Market appears to be more of a convenience store with a focus on souvenir items rather than a gourmet grocery store.
