After checking out, with maybe 10 items and spending more then $200 + I simply asked the cashier ‚Äúif they had a loaf of Italian bread where would it be? because I didn‚Äôt see any‚Äù.. the cashier calls DJ over to see if they have bread.\n\nBefore DJ even checks, he says with an attitude  ‚ÄúWELL if you don‚Äôt SEE ANY THEN WE DONT HAVE IT. BUT YOU CAN BUY ONE AND PUT IT IN THE OVEN AND MAKE IT YOURSELF IT only takes 10 MINUTES‚Äù (very rude and sassy with an attitude, moving his head all kinds of ways as he walks away to go check)\n\nKeep in mind, I had one simple question, ‚Äúif you have any loafs of Italian bread where would they be‚Äù I didn‚Äôt ask if someone can grab it for me, I didn‚Äôt ask how long it would take for me to make it. I just asked where would it be. I manage a store myself so I know how difficult it can be to work in retail, so I make sure I treat everyone extremely nice, as if it were my own store.\n\nAt this point I tell the cashier ‚Äúwow he‚Äôs really rude. We can cash out, I don‚Äôt even want the bread anymore‚Äù as I‚Äôm saying this to the cashier DJ is about 100 feet away saying ‚ÄúYOU WANT SEEDS OR NO SEEDS?‚Äù I tell DJ  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm okay I don‚Äôt want it‚Äù, he keeps yelling ‚Äúyou want seeds or no seeds‚Äù over and over. At this point I‚Äôm signing my name, he sees I‚Äôm not getting the bread from him, he‚Äôs well aware his behavior was rude, the cashier looks uncomfortable how DJ is responding. DJ walks up with the bread and then walks back away with the bread with an attitude.\n\nAs I‚Äôm going to leave I speak with a manager named J, I explain the situation, she apologies. Simple. (DJ is about 50 feet away listening. He knows I‚Äôm unhappy with the way he spoke to us) Now as I walk out, DJ goes HAVE A GOOD DAY! (Again in a rude, nasty, condescending way) This guy doesn‚Äôt know how to speak to customers.. I wasn‚Äôt even a difficult customer, I‚Äôm very easy going. I was in absolute shock as I‚Äôm leaving, after talking to his manager he still wants to get the last word in and show he doesn‚Äôt care how he treated me and my mother.\n\nTo DJ if you don‚Äôt know how to speak to clients, or like your job, maybe look else where because you DO NOT belong in customer service. I will make sure I make this clear across all platforms. DJ is toxic to that store, he was HOSTILE, RUDE, CONDESCENDING, and COMPLETELY UNPLEASANT. I genuinely feel bad for anyone that has to work with such a vile human being. The level of disrespect was beyond. DJ is a liability to that store with his behavior and the way he spoke to me was almost as if we were going to fight. He had that attitude as if he was right and he didn‚Äôt care because I can‚Äôt do anything. People that act the way he does will only push away customers and even staff members. Honestly, if he spoke to someone else the way he was speaking to us, I‚Äôm sure things could have gone way worse, even physical. DJ is aggressive and antagonistic.\n\nI am frequent customer, and everyone is always VERY pleasant. I dont know if I will ever go back to this specific location but I put this here because in my 14 years of retail, and in my entire lifetime, I HAVE NEVER BEEN SPOKEN TO LIKE THIS IN ANY RETAILER.\n\nThank you to the managers  Anthony and J for hearing about my experience and apologizing on the behalf of the unethical staff member DJ.', 'date': '2 months ago'}]"

The store's high customer ratings and reviews indicate a clientele that appreciates fine foods and could be interested in premium honey products. The store's emphasis on sourcing fine meats and cheeses, as well as its selection of imported goods, suggests that it caters to a market that values artisanal and specialty items, making it a suitable venue for a high-end honey brand. The only reason it does not receive a perfect score is the lack of explicit evidence that they currently carry honey or similar products, but the overall fit seems very promising.",9,0.0204,4.9,,"['Deli', 'Butcher shop deli', 'European restaurant']",[''],[''],"[{'question': {'user': {'name': 'Annette Jones', 'link': 'https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116419689925337489128', 'thumbnail': 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKyWU2SEolWnOS2jdpG-jz3hv8iR1wHAaihuD18jGYM=s120-c-rp-mo-br100'}, 'text': 'Do you carry gelpwurtz', 'date': '2 years ago', 'language': 'en'}, 'answer': {'text': 'not at this time', 'date': '2 years ago', 'language': 'en'}}]","[{'snippet': '""Great variety of unique foods, meats, desserts etc BUT, spent too much.""'}, {'snippet': '""Very clean place, lots of nice treats and food and even bagels.""'}, {'snippet': '""We grilled it with onions and peppers and ate in on a hoagie roll.""'}]","[{'username': 'Christopher Hughes', 'rating': 5, 'description': 'THIS PLACE IS A GEM!  Incredible selection of fine meats and cheeses sourced from NY, Chicago, and across Europe.  The owners, Mike and Jessica are wonderful and their care and love for what they do shines through in every interaction with customers.  This place is off the beaten path of Center street and surrounding areas, but it is a must visit if you are looking for some fine food and wonderful conversation.

That's the best pastrami I've ever had, Red Dragon mustard and ale cheddar, polish brine pickles, creamy cheddar, and duck pate. I also grabbed some focaccia,  but it was toasting in the oven.\n\nThe shop is run by two of the nicest people! I knew it was going to be good, because they were so proud of what they had. They wanted to make sure I tried things that I was curious about and quick to answer any question, or recommended a way to enjoy it. I can't speak highly enough about the place and I will be back regularly."", 'date': '8 months ago'}, {'username': 'racheid77', 'rating': 5, 'description': ""Beautiful store with wonderful people running it!

When I visited again last week, the only change I noticed was a greater variety of products.\nThey have a large selection of pre-packaged, shelf-stable products and fresh pastries and breads, but for me, the cheeses and cured meats are the main draw.
