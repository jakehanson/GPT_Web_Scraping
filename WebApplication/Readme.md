## Model Deployment

We need to host the results of the model on a public domain. For this, we use Flask to convert our python code to a Web Application, then AWS Elastic Beanstalk to deploy the Web Application.

UPDATE (08/22/24): No longer paying for AWS hosting, instead hosting static URL on GitHub Pages.
